# vanilla-todo-list

This is a simple todo application built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It uses local storage to store user credentials and user todos. Security is pretty weak.

Once Logged in the user can add, complete, edit and delete todos.

In this branch, the files were restructured to match prefered format, localStorage became reusable and auth was improved to check for valid user emails. Along with some code refactoring and style improvements.

## How to use

### You will need:

- A CLI like hyper or the VS Code Termiinal.
